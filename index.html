        <div class="gameDescription">
          A kind of puzzle in which one word must be transformed into another
          specified word of the same length by changing one letter at a time,
          each step yielding a valid intermediate word, as in lead → load → goad
          → gold.

        <div class="gameDescription">
          Jumble is a word puzzle with a clue, a drawing illustrating the clue,
          and a set of words, each of which is “jumbled” by scrambling its
          letters. A solver reconstructs the words, and then arranges letters at
          marked positions in the words to spell the answer phrase to the clue.
          The clue and illustration always provide hints about the answer
          phrase. The answer phrase frequently uses a homophone or pun.
