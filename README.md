You are going to want to create three folders with these exact names 
Main_Menu, Jumble,& Word_Ladder

In the Main_Menu folder place the files index.html and main-menu_styles.css
In the Jumble folder place the files: jumble-app.js, jumble-index.html, jumble-styles.css
In the Word_Ladder folder place these files within it: word_ladder_app.js, word_ladder_index.html, word_ladder_styles.css

Note that the styles and words are still a work in progress.
